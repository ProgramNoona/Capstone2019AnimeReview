To get started, you will need to install the libraries below. I would suggest using anaconda prompt as it makes the process simple. This project follows the flask tutorials found at "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH".

Run the commands below in anaconda prompt:

pip install flask-bcrypt
pip install flask-login
pip install flask
pip install flask-wtf
pip install sqlalchemy

After you have installed the libraries, navigate to the directory containing the program "run.py" in anaconda prompt:

cd <path>  ( path being the directory path where the folder was saved )

Once there, enter the command: 

python run.py

This command will enable flask and sqlalchemy to run on the localhost.

once running, open your browser and navigate to the following address:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
